	<h1>University of Maryland, College Park Panhellenic Association 2022 Exploratory Committee Report
</h1>

	<h2>General Information</h2>

	<h3>What is the primary reason our community wants/needs to add another NPC sorority?</h3>
	<p>To help us work with a growing community, the obvious reason is to lower chapter sizes as some of our chapter’s sizes have reached almost 180 members. However, with these growing chapters, we have also seen a drastic difference in the maximum and minimum of our chapters, so by adding another chapter, we would be able to see a more consistent chapter total throughout our community.</p>
	<p>The addition of another chapter also provides PNMs with another option to find others with similarities and would hopefully help to diversify our community and with a community that is growing and evolving, the new ideas and fresh faces to our community would help us continue to accomplish our long-term goals.</p>

	<h3>What do we hope a new sorority will bring to our community?</h3>
	<p>Become closer and to help us to grow as a community. I think the addition of a new sorority would help us to all find and discover the goals we have for our community and to begin working towards them. It can also help us grow as a community as we all work together to help to see this new chapter succeed. I also think our community provides so much support to one another, especially when it comes to our chapter’s philanthropic efforts and the addition of another philanthropy would be something that the entire community would be thrilled to have and support.</p>

	<h3> What is our campus known for?</h3>
	<p>For providing students with amazing networking opportunities as there is a strong alumni to university connection, especially within our Panhellenic community. Our campus is a campus that has constant construction, as any UMD student would tell you, but that tells us our community is growing and evolving. The university is continuing to grow and with that growth, we have seen different programs and majors on campus with new buildings and growing program opportunities. Our university is also known for offering a highly ranked, competitive education. A big reason a lot of students choose UMD and from what we have heard from our peers is the diversity found within our community.</p>

	<h3>What is Fraternity/Sorority life on our campus known for?</h3>
	<p>Being involved throughout our community and on campus. Many of our members are, of course, active in the Panhellenic community with there being many opportunities to hold a position within a chapter, but also on a board, cabinet, or committee for PHA, as well as, PHA executive positions. However, our members go above and beyond in the UMD community and are often known for holding positions in the community for many clubs and extracurriculars. Our members are also known for wanting to better the reputation of Fraternity and Sorority life through this involvement and want to see the future of our community continue to thrive through the changes of the world around us. And as I previously mentioned, we have a strong alumni-student connection with much of our alumni being active, involved, and always looking to support our community.</p>

	<h3>How does the campus administration promote positive relationships with Panhellenic and/or the Fraternity/Sorority community?</h3>
	<p>By hosting summits through the Department of Fraternity & Sorority Life. For example, at the beginning of both semesters, DFSL hosts a Fraternity & Sorority Leadership Summit for all Fraternity/Sorority Leaders including all four council executive boards and all chapter Presidents. They will also feature specific programs for certain positions and this may include a program for Chapter Risk Manager’s or Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Chairs. DFSL also encourages positive relationships between the Panhellenic community and also throughout the Fraternity/Sorority community as a whole by sharing different council events with one another and by hosting events for all four councils to enjoy.</p>

	<h3>What is the greatest challenge an incoming sorority may face in joining our community?</h3>
	<p>The oragnization may struggle with getting involved with starting out not as large as other chapters. As mentioned above, there are so many amazing things that our community has to offer, but it takes everyone’s commitment to be able to accomplish it all. An incoming sorority may struggle with having enough members to fulfill all requirements and optional activities. However, with the support of our community, PHA Executive Board, and DFSL, this chapter would be provided the resources and support to ensure they would excel and grow to become a perfect fit for our community.</p>


<h2>About our Panhellenic</h2>

	<p>Our College Panhellenic is known for evolving and working to better/educate ourselves on what we can improve on as a community. We’re focused on learning about the history of sororities and learning how we can better our community, so it is more accessible for all that are interested.
	Much of our community is extremely school-spirited and values our university and the education that we’re receiving from the school. Everyone is also extremely supportive and interested in what the school accomplishes and of course, they’re always there to support our sports teams.
	The community also continues to stay involved whether it be member involvement within their own chapters, within the Panhellenic community, the Fraternity/Sorority community, or the UMD community as a whole. Our members are staying busy supporting one another
</p>

	<p>The strengths of our Panhellenic include being welcoming, open-minded, and dedicated. Our community is open-arms to all who want or hope to join the Panhellenic community and as a whole, we have worked diligently to try to move away from the stigma that surrounds sororities and the reputation they’re given. Our members are dedicated to their chapters and their philanthropies, but also to PHA and to seeing the amazing change our community can make when we all come together.
	We always want to see what more our community can do and how much more we can push ourselves, no matter how big or small. Whether it’s pushing boundaries or raising money for a Friday philanthropy event, everyone is excited to see what we can do and what the future holds for Panhellenic at UMD.
	Our chapters are also extremely philanthropic with all 16 chapters having unique philanthropies that they fundraise, support, and donate to with the assistance of the other chapters in the Fraternity/Sorority community along the way.
	Our Panhellenic also encourages members to get involved and provides them with amazing opportunities to do so. This experience, specifically within leadership, prepares members for internships and real-world experience, so they’re better equipped to take on the “real world” upon graduation.
</p>

	<h3>The areas that our Panhellenic are working to improve include:</h3>
	<p>As we are an evolving community and are always improving, there are areas that we focus on when it comes to improving our community.</p>
	<p>We’re specifically working to improve in diversity, equity, and inclusion, and in making all UMD community members feel welcome to joining our Panhellenic community. Some ways we’re trying to improve this stems from our DEI series, which is put together in the fall by our Vice President of Diversity & Inclusion. This series consists of numerous events where speakers come to communicate to our community different topics centered around DEI. We’re also introducing new initiatives with DEI centering around recruitment, where chapter recruitment chairs will be required to share a presentation with their chapter members centered around DEI and its importance in the recruitment process.</p>
	<p>We’re also working on inter-council relations and inter-council relations. With the time of COVID, we saw a lot of separation in our community with people not being able to go out and spend time outside of their own homes and COVID really putting a divide within our community. However, with in-person events being back, we have reintroduced PHA pairs where the panhellenic chapters are matched up with another chapter for the semester and are expected to put together a bonding activity to help grow these inter-council relations.</p>
	<p>We also put on PHA Pride Week in the Fall to give our community a time to reflect and to be proud of what we do as a community and what we’re able to achieve every year.</p>
	<p>We’ve also begun working on inter-Greek council relations by encouraging PHA chapters to co-sponsor and support MGC, NPHC, and IFC chapters' philanthropy events and organizations. We just recently finished our first Greek Week with all four council’s involvement, which was put on by our VP of Community Affairs.<p>
	<p>While we’re still working to bring all members back to the same level of involvement that we had before COVID (and some), we have seen drastic changes in our community in recent years and know that while we have a lot to work on, we have even more to be excited about</p>

	<h3>Our Panhellenic provides leadership development for our officers and/or council by:</h3>
	<p>Leadership development is offered in our community via events that are put on by the PHA Executive Board, specifically during PHA Pride Week and through programming that is paid for by exec.</p>
	<p>A lot of chapters do specific leadership programming for their executive boards with their nationals or with their own chapters. These events could include things put on by the university that people in the community get involved with or events put on by individual chapters.</p>
	<p>Community members are also given a number of ways to hold positions whether it be within their own chapter and their chapter’s committees or it be on the Panhellenic Executive Board and within sub-committees of those positions. For example, there is the opportunity to be a Greek Week or Homecoming Chair. There’s the opportunity to be a Junior PHA Delegate, which is a position available to all immediate new members following primary recruitment. There’s the opportunity to be on the Recruitment cabinet or to be a recruitment counselor. As a recruitment counselor, you’re required to attend an eight week training to help you prepare to support and help the incoming PNMs during recruitment.</p>
	<p>DFSL also supports the PHA Executive Board in attending a leadership conference and also hosts two leadership conferences per year at the beginning of each semester to help councils come together and to help educate leaders in the community on resources and opportunities in the upcoming semester.</p>

	<h3>Panhellenic promotes positive relationships among NPC sororities by:</h3>
	<p>Every semester, a sorority is randomly paired with another to have a “PHA pair event” together. Some PHA pair events that two chapters have done in the past are cookie decorating, coffee and donut chats, self defense workshops, yoga classes, and more. The events are usually geared towards fostering positive relations between the two sororities and having sisters intermingle with each other.</p>
	<p>Typically, each sorority hosts a philanthropy event or more a semester. To raise more money for their actual philanthropies, a sorority will usually reach out to other NPC sororities to co-sponsor their event. For example, Alpha Delta Pi had about five other NPC sororities co-sponsor their Pizza with the Pi’s philanthropy event last fall. Co-sponsoring each other's philanthropy events further cultivates these positive relationships among NPC sororities here at UMD.</p>
	<p>Lastly, PHA executive board organizes “PHA Pride Week” over their social media, as well as having different events over the course of one week. Last PHA pride week, we had guest speakers, a hot chocolate hangout, and a self-defense workshop. There were also several social media hashtags and outlines for sisters of NPC sororities to post on their Instagram stories. They were encouraged to tag posts of them with their friends in other sororities, helping to foster inter-panhellenic relations.</p>

	<h3>Panhellenic cultivates positive relationships with other fraternities, sororities and councils by:</h3>
	<p>Panhellenic organizes several events to engage the whole Fraternity/Sorority community at UMD. Starting with Meet the Greeks, which is an event for potential members to join Fraternity/Sorority Life that occurs the first Wednesday that we’re back to school in the fall. All four councils are represented which makes it a good opportunity for people interested to learn more about the council and what each chapter is about.</p>
	<p>Homecoming week and Greek week are also events that PHA hosts for the Fraternity/Sorority community. Homecoming is always the week before our football homecoming game and there are events every evening the week of. Last semester, we had NPC sororities paired with IFC fraternities randomly, which was a great way to introduce sororities to new fraternities if they did not know each other well. Panhellenic organized a couple community service events for Homecoming week including a trash pick up around Fraternity Fields and Old Town, as well as partnering with Terps Against Hunger to package meals for those who are less fortunate. These events were huge successes and there was a big turnout for both. Greek Week occurs in the spring and is very similar to Homecoming week. The biggest difference was that all four councils were involved this time, which was an awesome opportunity. There were many competitive events that teams would face off in such as soccer, flag football, relay races, eating competitions, and sac races. Including all four councils made turnout larger and the week more fun overall.</p>
	<p>Lastly, PHA also organizes the IFC/PHA tailgates in the fall before each home football game. This is an opportunity for all of the NPC sororities and IFC fraternities to come together, and it gives them a chance to intermingle. There are games, music, and pizza at these events and a great way for Fraternity/Sorority life to come together at UMD, especially around the excitement of a big game.</p>


	<h2>Panhellenic Growth and Membership
</h2>

	<iframe title="Panhellenic Growth Since the Joining of Gamma Phi Beta" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-AVnwB" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AVnwB/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="276"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
	</script>

	<blockquote>Gamma Phi Beta joined our community and formally recruited in Primary Recruitment of Spring 2016. Prior to them joining, our community was made up of  2,061 members and over those seven years, our community has grown to 2,611 members despite many other universities seeing a drop in recruitment statistics.</blockquote>

	<iframe title="Primary Recruitment Registration Numbers for the Past Five Years:" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-HMb9r" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HMb9r/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 80% !important; border: none;" height="395"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
	</script>

	<h3>Based on trends on our campus and projections, we expect enrollment and recruitment sign ups over the next five years to?</h3>
	<p>Grow because we have been able to see an increase in recruitment numbers and enrollment.</p>
	<p>University of Maryland has also seen growth in housing options for students including on and off campus housing. There have been two new residence halls that have gone up in the past year and there are also going to be two new off-campus apartment complexes that will be available for rent in Fall 2022. We have seen recruitment numbers grow, and only saw a drop in 2021, which can be assumed it was due to COVID and the uncertainty of the year.</p>

	<h3>Our Panhellenic subscribes to NPC’s Values-Based Recruitment policy by doing things like?</h3>
	<p>Moving towards a focus on chapter values that align with PNM values. Our Panhellenic has consistently worked towards making our recruitment more values based.</p>
	<p>We now offer t-shirts from our Panhellenic Association that all PNMs will wear during values round to allow them to feel less of the pressure to buy a new outfit. This also allows for there to be less of a focus on what to wear and finding that “perfect outfit” because that’s not what recruitment is about.</p>
	<p>We have also lowered the cost of PNMs to register for recruitment from $50 to $15, with a $25 increase in the last month of registration, in the last three years. This money is used to buy their t-shirt for values round, so they know exactly what the money is being used for.</p>
	<p>We also require our chapters to share financial, housing, and commitment transparency presentations to all PNMs during philanthropy and community rounds to ensure that no PNM is surprised by the expectations of their chapter.
	Other than these changes we have placed specific rules and expectations in our recruitment agreement that provide our chapters with the necessary rules and expectations to maintain a values based recruitment.</p>

	<h2>Panhellenic Scholarship
</h2>

	<iframe title="Spring 2021 GPA statistics" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-71ApV" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/71ApV/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 80% !important; border: none;" height="179"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
	</script>

	<h3>How does Panhellenic provide support for academic achievement to NPC sororities?</h3>
	<p>By creating GroupMe’s based on member’s majors, so they’re able to reach out to other Panhellenic women for support and to be able to ask questions about classes and opportunities within their major. This also helps members to be able to build connections and meet other members in the Panhellenic community who may not be in their chapter, but that share the same major and academic interests.</p>
	<p>PHA also gives out four scholarships every semester, which include: GPA-jump, merit-based, community service, and needs-based. Additionally, during the spring semester, we give out new-member scholarships. Every semester, there are two recipients of each scholarship and usually additional new-member scholarships given out depending on funding. Each scholarship serves a unique purpose and helps to encourage our members while PHA is able to reward and support them.</p>

	<h2>Support for an Incoming NPC Organization</h2>

	<h3>What kind of marketing/publicity could PHA provide prior to/during extension?</h3>
	<p>The incoming NPC organization would be able to participate in the values round of 2023 primary recruitment and would then drop from the remaining rounds. This would give them amazing exposure with every PNM that is going through recruitment, so they’re made aware of the new organization and what values they hold.</p>
	<p>The chapter would also receive support from DFSL and PHA’s VP of Recruitment/COB chair as they would be given a list of names of PNMs who would be eligible to receive a COB following 2023 primary recruitment.</p>
	<p>In the fall of 2023, during Meet the Greeks, the new organization would have their own table to share information about their chapter and would also be able to participate in the COB fair to recruit eligible PNMs and to be able to grow their chapter community prior to 2024 primary recruitment.</p>
	<p>The news of a new chapter would also be something that would be told to PNMs during the interest meeting and kick-off and if a PNM removed themselves during primary recruitment, they would receive an email explaining COB to them and what that process looks like.</p>

	<h3>Help from College Panhellenic officers during extension:</h3>
	<p>All officers would be able to offer assistance in a different way and the easiest way to explain this would be to explain within each position of our executive board what our council could do.</p>
	<p>The VP of Recruitment would be able to assist with supporting the new organization in finding available PNMs who are eligible to accept COBs. She would also be available in assisting the new organization in helping them set up and knowing what to expect during the values round of 2023 primary recruitment. The VP of Recruitment would continue to assist the new chapter in their recruitment efforts in the upcoming year as they learn the process at UMD.</p>
	<p>The President would be able to assist the founding member class to create an executive board, so that they have structured leadership to help guide them to success. This would also allow them to have representation at all UMD PHA meetings, including delegates and presidents meetings thus allowing them to have a say on what is happening in the future of our community.</p>
	<p>The VP of Accountability would be able to explain and review by-laws with the founding member class, but specifically the executive board. She would be able to support the organization in finding representation for the judicial board giving the new organization more representation in our community. She is here to serve as an advocate for supporting all NPC councils.</p>
	<p>The VP of Administrative Affairs would be able to assist the new organization in helping them to organize a budget, as well as aid the new chapter in building communication both within their chapter and within the community.</p>
	<p>The VP of Risk Management would be able to educate the new organization on issues surrounding alcohol, drugs, sexual assault, mental health, etc. and would be able to provide them the necessary resources within our community and on campus that help our members to feel safe.</p>
	<p>The VP of Community Affairs would be able to share scholarship opportunities and academic support to the chapter as they’re adjusting and would also be able to help them to get involved with Greek Week, Homecoming, and PHA Pairs. All events that would help them to get involved within the council, but also within all four councils and the community as a whole.</p>
	<p>The VP of Public Relations would be able to assist in marketing this new organization whether it be making flyers or posting about them via social media. She would also be able to add the organization to the UMD PHA website and to assist them in creating and developing their own social media channels to give them as much exposure as possible.</p>
	<p>The VP of Membership Development would be able to help the new organization to get involved in Junior PHA. This would give the chapter more involvement and she would also be able to discuss and share the values of our Panhellenic community and how chapters are expected to uphold and reflect those values.</p>
	<p>The VP of Diversity & Inclusion would be able to help the new chapter to understand what DEI means in our community by pointing them towards events put on in support of DEI and by helping them to find a DEI chair who would be able to attend a training where she would learn more of this importance and be able to educate her chapter.</p>
	<p>The tasks listed above include things that our current board does daily for our sixteen chapters and there is no holding back in expanding this support and sharing resources to the new organization.</p>

	<h2>Alumnae</h2>

	<h3>An incoming sorority needs to provide these types of alumnae support to their chapter for it to be successful:</h3>
	<p>Current organizations have a wide range of alumnae support. Panhellenic chapters all have alumnae Chapter Advisors, as well as alumnae involved on advisory boards and house corporation boards to support our organizations.</p>
	<p>These volunteers as well as other local and national alumnae play vital roles in supporting our chapters. Advisors and House Corporations regularly communicate with chapters and the DFSL. They help provide a safe living environment and encourage and promote continued education of our organizations’ and campus’ missions. Alumnae participate in chapters philanthropy through their donations of cash or goods and services and even donating their time.</p>
	<p>Pre-Covid chapter expectations included alumni programming requirements where chapters planned events ranging from networking and resume and career building to Homecoming and anniversary celebrations. Alumnae can act as mentors and help provide leadership training to chapter members. While many of our chapters have a strong history with their UMD chapter alumnae, our closeness to the District of Columbia and surrounding Maryland and Virginia communities also allows our chapters to have access and communications with and support from a wide community of alumnae.</p>

	<h2>Housing & Facilities</h2>

	<h3>Does an incoming sorority needs housing to be successful in our community? Why or Why not?</h3>
	<p>Overall, having a facility for an incoming sorority at UMD could be seen as essential due to other sororities having a chapter facility, which provides members a communal space. The facility is one of the ways that bonds between members can be created and also provides a space for many needs of the sorority. Sororities also use their chapter facilities to host PNMs during primary recruitment and it helps sororities to feel included in the living experience of Fraternity/Sorority life as many members of the community either live on Fraternity Row or in Old Town. Having a house to foster closer relationships in a new chapter as it grows could also be very important to build community and keep it strong throughout the process.</p>
	<p>However, by having a sorority on campus that does not have a chapter facility, it could appeal to students who commute, as well as, students who may not be able to afford dues including a chapter facility. A sorority that did not have a chapter facility would see a drastic decrease in their dues, which could appeal to some.</p>

	<iframe title="Available 2023 Housing Facilities" aria-label="Locator maps" id="datawrapper-chart-02J56" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/02J56/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 80% !important; border: none;" height="575"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
	</script>

	<h3>Describe campus facilities that are used by sororities for typical functions and the availability of these facilities or land to build a competitive facility for an incoming sorority.</h3>
	<p>Currently, all UMD PHA chapters have a chapter facility which is either university-owned or privately owned. The chapter facility is used for recruitment, chapter meetings, and provides a space for members to fellowship and connect. All University-owned facilities are leased out and there is possibility for a privately-owned facility.</p>
	<p>Chapters also meet in the STAMP Student Union for chapter meetings (depending on chapter size) and The Armory which is an on-campus building that is located at the end of McKeldin Mall in the center of campus. All of which are easily available to chapters through university booking.</p>
